This Ruby code is defining a Chef resource for creating a MySQL database. 

Here's what it does in plain English:

- It includes the `mysql::server` resource, which likely provides necessary settings and dependencies for setting up a MySQL server.
- The `define mysql::db` block creates a new database with the name specified by the `${name}` variable (which is probably defined elsewhere in the recipe).
- If the command `/usr/bin/mysql -uroot ${name}` returns a non-zero exit status, it means the MySQL server is not running. In this case, the `create-${name}-db` resource will be created.
- The actual database creation happens when the `create-${name}-db` resource is triggered. It uses the command `/usr/bin/mysql -uroot -e "create database ${name}"` to create a new database with the specified name.
- The `require => Service["mysql"]` line ensures that the MySQL service must be running before creating the database, which prevents potential issues if the server is not up and running.
