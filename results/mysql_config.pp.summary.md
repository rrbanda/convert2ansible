This Chef recipe is used to configure a MySQL server. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. It sets up the basic directory structure for the MySQL service, including the `/root/.my.cnf` file and the `/etc/mysql` and `/etc/mysql/conf.d` directories.
2. If a new root password is specified, it updates the existing root password using `mysqladmin`. If no new password is provided, it leaves the current password unchanged.
3. It sets up the MySQL configuration file (`/etc/my.cnf`) by templating a template file (`mysql/my.cnf.erb`). The template is only applied if a new root password was specified.
4. It creates a directory for the SSL certificates and configuration files if `ssl` is enabled.
5. If `restart` is set to `true`, it restarts the MySQL service after making any changes.

In summary, this recipe configures the basic MySQL settings, updates the root password (if provided), sets up the configuration file, and restarts the service if necessary.
